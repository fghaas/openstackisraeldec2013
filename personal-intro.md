Hello everyone.
Note: Shalom LeKulam.


I would like to start with a few personal words of my own,
Note:


and I thank you in advance for tolerating my accent.
Note:


This is my second OpenStack Israel.
Note:


And the first one, in May, 
Note:


had a profound impact
Note:


on my professional and personal life.
Note:


Over the last few months, I have had the pleasure
Note:


of interacting with
Note:


enormously intelligent, professional,
Note:


and unreservedly honest people from this community.
Note:


And up to this point,
Note:


throughout my travels, 
Note:


I have never felt so immediately welcome 
Note:


in any other country I have visited.
Note:


So for all of that,
Note:


thank you very much.
Note: And now, let's cut to our advertised topic.
